# Battleship for Arduino UNO
Battleship for Arduino UNO is a battleship game coded with Arduino/C++ using an Arduino UNO and a 32x16 LED RGB Matrix. The game consists of the end-user, a CPU as the second player, and each player with an 8x8 grid.

# Motivation
This project is for experimenting with the Arduino and attempting to making a game using an LED Matrix as a display. This project can also be used by others to learn from and experiment with.

# Latest Version
The latest version for this project is currently in the alpha development phase, and hasn't been fully implemented yet. Implementation will be added in future commits.

# Documentation
In a later version, all documentation about Battleship for Arduino UNO is in /docs.

# Requirements
To run this project properly, you will require an Arduino UNO board, and a 32x16 RGB LED Matrix, specifically [this one](https://www.adafruit.com/products/420). You will need to set this up using the documentation provided on the website, and install the libraries needed for Arduino.
